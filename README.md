# Propylon Document Manager Assessment

The Propylon Document Management Technical Assessment is a simple (and incomplete) web application consisting of a basic API backend and a React based client.  This API/client can be used as a bootstrap to implement the specific features requested in the assessment description. 

## Getting Started
### API Development
The API project is a [Django/DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) project that utilizes a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for a convenient interface to access development utilities. This application uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as the default persistence database you are more than welcome to change this. This project requires Python 3.11 in order to create the virtual environment.  You will need to ensure that this version of Python is installed on your OS before building the virtual environment.  Running the below commmands should get the development environment running using the Django development server.
1. `$ make build` to create the virtual environment.
2. `$ make fixtures` to create a small number of fixture file versions.
3. `$ make serve` to start the development server on port 8001.
4. `$ make test` to run the limited test suite via PyTest.

### Client Development 
The client project is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) that has been tested against [Node v18.19.0 Hydrogen LTS](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.19.0/).  An [.nvmrc](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file) file has been included so that the command `$ nvm use` should select the correct NodeJS version through NVM.
1. Navigate to the client/doc-manager directory.
2. `$ npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. `$ npm start` to start the React development server.


#### Running client tests
```
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for development  
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
npm run test:ci           # CI-specific test run
npm run lint              # Run ESLint
make check-all            # Run full test suite
