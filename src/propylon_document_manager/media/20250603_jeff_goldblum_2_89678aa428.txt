"Jeff Goldblum and the Temporal Espresso"

One misty morning in Venice, Jeff Goldblum was wandering the cobbled alleys in search of the perfect espresso. As he ducked into a peculiar café with no sign—just a shimmering hourglass in the window—he was greeted by a barista who looked suspiciously like Albert Einstein in a denim apron.

“One espresso, with a twist of time,” the barista said before Jeff even ordered.

Jeff chuckled in that signature, staccato way of his. “Ah, mysterious. I like it. Let’s roll the dice of destiny.”

The espresso arrived in a porcelain cup that seemed to radiate a gentle warmth. Jeff took a slow, curious sip. Instantly, the air rippled. The café blurred and blinked out of sight, and suddenly he stood on the set of Jurassic Park—but not as himself. No, he was the T. rex in a sleek leather jacket, dodging a group of scientist-actors shouting, “Life finds a Zoom link!”

One velociraptor handed him a mirror. “You are the anomaly,” it hissed.

Then he snapped back—seated once more in the café. The espresso cup was now empty, steam still curling lazily in the air. The barista gave him a sly smile. “You’ve just experienced Quantum Roast. Come again next week if you’d like to visit 1985... or maybe your high school prom.”

Jeff blinked, adjusted his glasses, and whispered to himself, “Delicious. Bewildering. Ten out of ten.”

And he walked off, humming jazz, a little more timeless than before.
