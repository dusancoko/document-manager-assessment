"Jeff Goldblum and the Temporal Espresso"

One misty morning in Venice, Jeff Goldblum was wandering the cobbled alleys in search of the perfect espresso. As he ducked into a peculiar café with no sign—just a shimmering hourglass in the window—he was greeted by a barista who looked suspiciously like Albert Einstein in a denim apron.

“One espresso, with a twist of time,” the barista said before Jeff even ordered.

Jeff chuckled in that signature, staccato way of his. “Ah, mysterious. I like it. Let’s roll the dice of destiny.”

The espresso arrived in a porcelain cup that seemed to hum softly. Jeff sipped. Instantly, the world shimmered. The café dissolved around him, and suddenly he stood on the set of Jurassic Park—but not in the past. No, the dinosaurs were filming him, and he was the T. rex in a leather jacket trying to escape a group of scientist-actors yelling, “Life finds a Zoom link!”

One velociraptor handed him a mirror. “You are the anomaly,” it hissed.

Then he woke up—back in the café. The espresso was gone. The barista winked. “You’ve just experienced Quantum Roast. Come back next week if you’d like to visit 1985... or your third birthday.”

Jeff blinked, adjusted his glasses, and whispered to himself, “Delicious. Bewildering. Ten out of ten.”

And he walked off, humming jazz, a little more timeless than before.
